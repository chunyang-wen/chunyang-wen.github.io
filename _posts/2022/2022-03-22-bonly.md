title: Buffer only in vim
categories: [tools]
tags: [vim]

I am using [coc-pywright](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-pyright) to jump to
the definition for programming in python. I have set it up to open a vertically split
window. Sometimes I just want to keep current buffer in order to fully spread it
on the screen.

+ toc
{:toc}

## What I want?

A command or a shortcut to close all the buffers except current buffer. For example:

```vimscript
:BufferOnly

<leader>+o " o is short for only.
```

## Reference from google

+ [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4545275/vim-close-all-buffers-but-this-one/71559367#71559367)
+ [close-buffers.vim](https://github.com/Asheq/close-buffers.vim/blob/master/plugin/close-buffers.vim)
+ [BufOnly](https://github.com/vim-scripts/BufOnly.vim/blob/master/plugin/BufOnly.vim)

Basically there are two ways:

+ Close all buffers and use `edit #` to reopen current buffer
+ Use a plugin which defines command and search for the specific buffer

The first solution will cause the screen to flush and if not configured correct we
will lose the editing position we previously working on.

```vimscript
nnoremap <leader>o :%bd\|e#<CR>
nnoremap <leader>o :execute '%bdelete\|edit #\|normal `"'\|bdelete#<CR>
```

The first command will close all buffers and reopen current buffer, but it will lose the
editing position. The second command will close all the buffers, reopen current buffer
and return to previous editing position. But it wlll cause the screen to flush and lose the
cursor position (Not visible until we move the position)

## Make my hand dirty

Try my best to learn the basic language of `vimscript` from following websites:

+ [Learning Vimscript the Hard way](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com)
+ [Vimscript cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/vimscript)
+ [Vim basics](https://learnvim.irian.to/vimscript/vimscript-conditionals-and-loops)

I come out with my own solution

```vimscript
function! CloseOtherBuffer()
    let l:bufnr = bufnr()
    for buffer in getbufinfo()
        if !buffer.listed
            continue
        endif
        if buffer.bufnr == l:bufnr
            continue
        else
            if buffer.changed
                echo buffer.name . " has changed, save first"
                continue
            endif
            let l:cmd = "bdelete " . buffer.bufnr
            execute l:cmd
        endif
    endfor
endfunction

nnoremap <leader>o :call CloseOtherBuffer()<CR>
```

I have defined leader to `,` previously using `let mapleader=","`.

The idea is simple:

+ Find my buffer number
+ Iterate all listed buffers and close those whose buffer number are not equal to my
buffer number.

After carefully reading the code of `close-buffers.vim` and `BufOnly.vim`, I found out
that the idea and implementations are similar.

```vimscript
:help getbufinfo
:help bufnr
```

### Trips

+ `bdelete buffer.bufnr` not working. Vimscript does not replace variable
with its value

```vimscript
" Works
let l:cmd = "bdelete " . "buffer.bufnr
execute l:cmd

" Not working, buffer.bufnr not replaced with the actual number
bdelete buffer.bufnr
```

+ Should `filter` will buffer property `listed`, otherwise there will be other buffers
which are not edited appears.
